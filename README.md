# A Sample Node.js Container to run on ResinOS

This is a small "Hello, World!" webserver example which is designed to show you how to quickly get up and running with [`rdt`](https://github.com/resin-os/resin-device-toolbox) and [resinOS](resinos.io).

1. Clone this repo, 
2. Make sure `rdt` is installed,
3. ensure your resinOS device is connected on your local network and is advertising as `resin.local`
4. run `rdt push -s .`
